I&#39;ve always been a nerd at heart. I grew up in the Southbay of Los Angeles, spent some time up north in Chico, then made my way back down to socal. I&#39;ve always enjoyed things re: tech. I have a 3D printer that I built and love tinkering with. This along with the many Raspberry Pis, Odroids, and servers I play with give me ample opportunity to learn new things.
I spent the last 7 years working in the tech industry. I have experience working and running an Operations Center, along with hands on Linux, Unix, Development and Networking experience. I&#39;ve worked in startup environments requiring many hats, and in more corporate environments with more defined roles.
I also enjoy the great universe that is Star Trek. If you ever want to get a Roll20 Star Trek Adventures game going, just let me know :D
